## Prestige Notes

Prestige is available when you have at least 10,000 elemental (air, earth, water, fire) or catalytic (astral, law, blood, wrath) runes. Upon prestiging, for every 10,000 elemental runes you have, you will get 1 elemental stone, and for every 10,000 catalytic runes you have, you will get 1 catalytic stone. These stones are used to purchase Prestige Upgrades. Also, you will get an xp and rune crafting bonus equal to the total number of elemental and catalytic stones you gain from prestiging to the next level.

Runecrafting Cape: Gives an invisible +1 level bonus, allowing you to craft runes 1 level before their required level. Buying this upgrade unlocks the Trimmed Runecrafting Cape upgrade which is 10 elemental and 10 catalytic stones.

Trimmed Runecrafting Cape: Removes level requirement to craft runes.

Smashing!(!!/!!!): Auto mines 10/20/30 essence every second.

Orbs: Orbs require a battlestaff to be attached to. Once attached, gives an infinite supply of the specific rune. You can only have 1 staff at a time equipped. Upon crafting a staff when you already have one equipped, your currently equipped staff will turn back into an orb. (Law Staff will remove the law rune requirement when charging the Ring of the Elements)

Battlestaff: Battlestaves will randomly drop when you craft a rune. The base chance is 1/1000.
